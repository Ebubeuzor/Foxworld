Project Overview

This Laravel‑based e‑commerce solution caters to fashion retailers and shoppers alike. It offers a complete shopping experience—from browsing curated collections and adding items to cart, through secure checkout, to order tracking and customer support.

Over six months of development, I spearheaded backend architecture, optimized performance, integrated real‑time features, and ensured operational reliability for high traffic during sales and promotions.

Key Features

User Management• Registration, login, and profile management with email verification and password reset.

Product Catalog• Dynamic categories and tags, advanced filters (size, color, price range), and live search powered by Scout + Algolia.

Shopping Cart & Checkout• Persistent cart sessions, coupon codes, discount rules, and seamless Stripe payment integration.

Order Management• Real‑time order status updates (pending → processing → shipped → delivered), plus order history and invoice generation.

Admin Dashboard• CRUD for products, categories, users, orders; sales analytics, inventory alerts, and role‑based access control.

Real‑Time Notifications• WebSocket notifications for order updates and stock alerts (Pusher / Laravel WebSockets).

Customer Support Chat• In‑app chat between customers and support agents, with message history and file attachments.

Reviews & Ratings• Customers can leave product reviews; admins can moderate or feature top reviews.

Architecture & Design

Modular Laravel• Service‑oriented structure with separate modules for Storefront, Cart, Orders, and Admin.

Caching Layer• Redis for page fragments (nav bars, product recommendations) and full‑page caching on static pages.

Database Design• MySQL with composite indexes, pivot tables for many‑to‑many relationships (products ↔ tags), and audit tables for change logging.

Queues & Workers• Laravel Queues (Redis driver) for email notifications, invoice generation, and search indexing.

API‑First• RESTful endpoints for mobile apps and third‑party integrations, documented with OpenAPI/Swagger.
